# finalProjectCompression

This project is a compression algrithm using the logic behind huffman encoding created by me.

It takes a single command line parameter of a text file. That file will create a binary value for every character
in the text based on usage(as per huffman encoding)

The output will be a compressed file with the condoings and their respective letters. after a weight of all
the values together and the text translated to binary.
